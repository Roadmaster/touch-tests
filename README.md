Touch tests
===========

These tests help verify specific touch actions or gestures, by presenting an easy
interaction for the user to complete and automatically verifying that it was performed.

These focus on higher layers, since we want to evaluate the actual user experience,
similar to how audio testing focuses on user-visible pulseaudio, rather than developer-
oriented ALSA.

The tests require qmlscene, QtQuick 2.0 and Qt5 with QML.
